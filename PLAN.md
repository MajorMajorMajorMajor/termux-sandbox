# Termux Sandbox Plan

## High Level Plan
1. Finish feature development
2. Refactor/clean up - GitHub-ready
3. Make termux-sandbox into a package, while asb stays just a standalone script

## NEXT
- Align docs/specs with current implementation
- Add repo distribution essentials (license, contribution docs, release notes)
- Add lint/quality checks for public GitHub use

## FUTURE (out of scope)
- Add additional sandbox management features to `asb`:
  - list
  - delete
  - reset
  - copy
  - take snapshot
  - revert to snapshot
- Shell integration (auto-set title or terminal badge)
