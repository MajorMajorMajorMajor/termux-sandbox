# Termux Sandbox Plan

## High Level Plan
1. Finish feature development
2. Refactor/clean up - GitHub-ready
3. Make termux-sandbox into a package, while asb stays just a standalone script

## NEXT
- Add additional sandbox management features to `asb`:
  - list
  - delete
  - reset
  - copy
  - take snapshot
  - revert to snapshot

## FUTURE
Out-of-scope ideas
- Shell integration (auto‑set title or terminal badge)
